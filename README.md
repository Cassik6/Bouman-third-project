# Data Analysis Project

## Mission

The main tasks for this project is to complete an analysis and interpretation of our main dataset.
Those tasks are done in order to have everything required to achieve the goal of this project : predict prices on Belgium's Real Estate sales.
As a optional goal, based on our work, we had to estimate which machine learning would be the most suited to solve our problematic. 

## Participants

- Mikael Dominguez (Project manager)
- Selma Esen
- Opap's Ditudidi
- Christophe Giets

## Our process

The three following task in order to setup our team with necessary tools were tackled pretty quickly by reparting the work between the members.
- Create a Trello (https://trello.com/invite/b/KPxOlDhV/4d82988031b544b4148e1eef8787ad01/data-project)
- Create the Github (https://github.com/Cassik6/Bouman-third-project)
- Collect the data (See task 0 here under)

### 0. Collect and Join the datasets

Our first given task was to collect the datasets delivered by each group from the first project ("Immoliza").
After all the datasets were collected, we had to join them in one main dataset.
Once each group had a complete dataset, the project leaders had to meet in order to decide which common dataset would be used by all the groups as a base to really start to work on the project.


### 1. Data Cleaning

The Data Cleaning was definitely the biggest challenge for this project. And to accomplish the other steps and reach our final goal, we had to make sure we had a proper dataset to work on. Therefore, the Project Manager allocated most of the workforce to this single task.

We devided the data cleaning in three main parts :

#### a) Suppressing duplicates :
As our main dataset was composed of small datasets really similar, we had a lot of overlapping data's. In other words, duplicates.
************EXPLAIN HOW YOOU DID IT **************

#### b) Adjusting formats : 
Once we cleared as many duplicates as possible, we had to make sure the format of our values in a single column were all similar to be able to use them correctly later on in the project.
************EXPLAIN HOW YOOU DID IT **************

#### c) Trimming : 
After the first two tasks, we could still notice many data's that would not make sense or that after some research would reveal some duplicates left in the dataset.
As most of the cleaning was already done and this task is really time consuming we decided to keep this task for the end of the project if we had some time left.
************EXPLAIN HOW YOOU DID IT **************

 
### 2. Data Analysis

This part really required a clean dataset to be performed. So we couldn't get any further before step one was over. 
To make a clear answer to the following questions we made a distinction between three  different type of variables :

- Measurable variables : Such as number of rooms or area
- Address variables : The variables related to the address of the property (Locality, Postcode, Province)
- Binary variables : Where the variable is simply a True/False. (e.g: Is there a pool in the house)

Questions:

- Which variable is the target ? The price is the key element in our analysis as we had to predict prices we had to analysis its variation depending on the different variables
- How many rows and columns ?************TO BE ADDED AT THE LAST MINUTE **************
- What is the correlation between variable/target ? (Why?) 
- What is the correlation between the variables/variables ? (Why?) 
- Which variables have the greatest influence on the target ?
- Which variables have the least influence on the target ?
- How many qualitative and quantitative variable is there ? How would you transform these values into numerical values ?
- Percentage of missing values per column ?

### 3. Data Interpretation
