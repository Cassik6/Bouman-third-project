# Data Analysis Project

## Mission

The main objective for this project is to complete an analysis and interpretation of different datasets in order to predict prices on Belgium's Real Estate sales.

## Participants

- Mikael Dominguez (project manager)
- Selma Esen
- Opap's Ditudidi
- Christophe Giets

## Our process

After completing the "task 0" which was common to everyone and wasn't yet part of our team work, we identified the necessary steps in order to complete our project.
Despite the different steps in order to progress towards our goal, we decided to work simultaneously on different tasks (steps).

### 0. Collect and Join the datasets

Our first given task was to collect the datasets delivered by each group from the first project ("Immoliza").
After all the datasets were collected, we had to join them in one main dataset.
Once each group had a complete dataset, the project leaders had to meet in order to decide which common dataset would be used by all the groups as a base to really start to work on the project.

### 1. Data Cleaning

The Data Cleaning was definitely the biggest challenge for this project. In order to complete the other steps and reach our final goal, we had to make sure we had a clean dataset.

This is why we decided to put most of our efforts (and team members) on this task.

We devided the data cleaning in two main parts :

#### a) Suppressing duplicates :
As our main dataset was composed of small datasets really similar, we had a lot of overlapping data's. In other words, duplicates.

#### b) Adjusting format : 

#### c) Trimming : 

## Tasks

- Create a Trello (done)
- Create the Github (done)
- Collect the data


- Which variable is the target ?
- How many rows and columns ?
- What is the correlation between variable/target ? (Why?)
- What is the correlation between the variables/variables ? (Why?)
- Which variables have the greatest influence on the target ?
- Which variables have the least influence on the target ?
- How many qualitative and quantitative variable is there ? How would you transform these values into numerical values ?
- Percentage of missing values per column ?
